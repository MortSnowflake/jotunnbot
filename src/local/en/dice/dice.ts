      "**__Ironsworn Action Roll__** n Produces an Action Roll from the _Ironsworn_ engine. \n \nTo execute the Action Roll, simply use the command `ironsworn-action` or one of its aliases. You can include any number of integers that will be considered modifiers. The text is ignored, allowing you to add a description to your lists: n ,, n.ironsworn-action Rolling to Comverse to make me skip by telling him Iâ€™m dealing with a prince. +2 Shadow and +1 for my Secure Advantage. '' The command has multiple aliases (`is`,`act` and `a`). All you need are numeric modifiers; the text is purely for flavor. All aliases work the same: \n``` \n.is Coercing a guard with a lie: +2 Shadow, +1 Protected Advantage ,, \n```, \n.act Compel +2 s +1 SA ``` \n `+` 'can be omitted, just like any text: n```na 2 1``` \nYou can put as much text and as many modifiers on the roll as 2000 Discord Symbol limit will allow.",
